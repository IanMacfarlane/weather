This is a weather web app that uses the api https://ipstack.com/check to get the latitiude and longitute of your location based on your ip address and the https://openweathermap.org/api api to get the weather of your location using that latitude and longitute. 
The app then uses the Vue.js front end framework to create a dynamic webpage that displays the current weather and the 5 day 3 hour forcast.
The web app also uses vue to allow you to click on the weather forcasts to vote on weather you think that the weather is likely or unlikely to occur.
